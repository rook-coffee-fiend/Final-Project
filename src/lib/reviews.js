          review: "Featured kitty: Buddy! Buddy is the most dapper man in the whole world. His tuxie brother Felix is a food goblin who will fully eat through plastic to get at anything remotely edible, and their all-black sister Buffy has to be kept away from Buddy at all times, or she'll try to fight him."

          review: "Bethany has been our cat sitter since June 2024. We have a sweet rescue cat who can often be distrustful of everybody but us. Bethany is so incredibly kind and patient. She completely understands that our cat is stressed out because moms aren’t home- and also, we don’t quite know her history prior to adoption. Bethany doesn’t mind the hissing and empty threats and sends us progress pics when she’s able to inch closer. Most recently she was even able to pet our cat!! We are so grateful to have someone who we trust wholeheartedly and who really GETS cats to watch our Stevie. Even if our cat’s bad manners towards her embarrasses us every single time. Bethany is prepared, thoughtful, loving, and spends ample amounts of time with Stevie during her visits. We would highly recommend!-Lindsay & Maggie"

          review: "Bethany has been our primary cat sitter for our kitty Peta for a couple years, and we feel so lucky to have her. She works hard to develop a great relationship with her clients and pets. The peace of mind we have when we’re away is directly related to how much Bethany cares about and cares for our pet. She is knowledgeable, communicates daily with photos, and truly understands our expectations. Our kitty loves spending time with her. There is a high level of care and engagement Bethany brings that makes her an excellent sitter. We are very happy customers! -Liz K."

          review: "Nanette is a delicate dame with a creaky little meow. She enjoys a daily dish of goat milk, has become increasingly discerning about the quality of her cat food, and, in lieu of a suitable sunbeam, thoroughly enjoys lounging on her heating pad on her armchair."

          review: "Jasper is an absolutely gigantic white cat with grey patches. He's not particularly overweight, either- he's just extra-large! He's a sweet little man who enjoys being picked up, and beeps at his humans when it's dinner. Pooky, his much smaller, much more shy brother, lets Jasper bring out his silly side. The two of them race each other up and down the hall to get their daily steps in."

Between the three of them, they have half a dozen diagnoses that require medical management- a service I'm more than happy to provide for three such sweet little guys!"

          review: "Jasper is a mischief man and a connessieur of shoelaces. All things remotely string-like have to be kept securely in drawers, closets, or outside of the apartment entirely, because this guy just can't seem to help himself! When he's not eating things he shouldn't, he's playing voraciously, begging to be picked up, or snuggled up to his favorite people for a nap."
