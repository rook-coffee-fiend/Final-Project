		I first moved to Boston in fall of 2022- it was my first time living on my own post-graduation, and it took some getting used to. 
		Gone were the days of dorm living, where everyone I knew was just a ten minute walk across campus away. Instead, my friends were 
		scattered across the city: Allston, Cambridge, Fenway, and even as far south as Quincy. Relying on public transit meant it could 
		take as much as an hour in transit one way- socializing had to be planned out well in advance if I wanted to make it happen.

		It was isolating living in Jamaica Plain- I didnâ€™t know anyone in my neighborhood! Even my new coworkers, who would eventually 
		become close friends, lived out of practical reach for the day-to-day. What was a girl to do?
